# Gender Classification



## Folder Structure

```
└── data
│   └── raw
│   │   └── Testing
│   │   └── Training
└── helper
└── models
└── notebooks

```

### Data 
This folder contain dataset **raw** and **clean** to work with, this folder mean to be filled with all data to
work with in future 

### Helper
This folder contain function that used for external function that need to cleaning or process output

### Models 
This folder contain ML model to work with multiple model implementation can be store here 

### Notebooks
This folder contain notebook to present or to documented working process or flow to be tracked in future


## Work Flow

We will have 3 main working branch and 1 main branch 

- data-preps
- modeling
- evaluation
- master

`master` branch is main branch so we **PROHIBITED** to update branch unless from _pull request_

when you're working you need to create new branch with this format `stage/date yyyy-mm-dd`

example:
> data-preps/2021-10-03
